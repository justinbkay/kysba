#This is an attempt at making a website using Nodejs libraries.

##Project dependencies
I'm using express, mongoose (mongodb), and jade.  

It uses mongodb as the session store and takes advantage of sessions
to provide a password protected area.

It also takes advantage of the Twitter Bootstrap project.
